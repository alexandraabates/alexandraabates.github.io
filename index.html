<h1>Alexandra Bates</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Alexandra! I'm on a gap year from Columbia to learn ML and help organize MAIA and CBAI. I previously studied physics and math with a focus on quantum information theory, but have recently started thinking about how to ensure that artificially intelligent systems are developed safely. Feel free to reach out to me at alexandra [dot] bates [at] columbia [dot] edu :) </p>
